         <h2>About Jinx</h2>
         <p>Jinx grew up with her sister Vi after their parents got killed during a fight between the Up-Side and the Down-side. Vlander, a good hearted man took them both in and did his best to keep them out of trouble. During thoses days Jinx was called Powder and even tho she always had good intentions she got herself and other in trouble on the regular. Powder and Vi were inseperable and whenever Powder caused trouble her sister did never bat an eye to protect her. After a few incidences both sisters got seperated which lead to Jinx joining the bad side because she thought that her sister left her behind. </p>
